This is a 288x288 wav2lip model version.
Some Features I will implement here
- [x] input size 288x288
- [x] PRelu
- [x] LeakyRelu
- [x] Gradient penalty
- [x] Wasserstein Loss
- [ ] Kubeflow for training process
- [ ] Orthogonal regularization with gradient penalty

I trained my own model on AVSPEECH dataset and then transfer learning with my private dataset.
